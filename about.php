        I am a 21 years old student of Telecommunication Engineering, in Politechnic University of Madrid. I love technology and I'm always learning new things about it. This is my first webpage developed in PHP and I'm sure that it isn't going to be the only one. Aside from technologies, I'm discovering the world and I will share all my experiences with you. I look forward to make this project grow up :)
